To build the data:
1. Create a directory name it 'data_expression' move the expression data inside.
2. Move the 'upstream_sequences.tsv' to the working directory.
3. Run the cells in order. If the data from all of the 32 species are not extracted uncomment the cell to continue to gather data.

4. After the expression data of 32 species gathered run to get the sequence data and merge it. (Question: Do you think inner merge makes sense here?)
